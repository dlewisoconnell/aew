AEW Watch-Along is a web-based game for fans of All Elite Wrestling (AEW) to play while watching AEW events. Users can create up to four teams, draft AEW wrestlers to their teams, and update their scores based on the outcome of each match. 

The game is built using a series of inputs, dropdown menus and buttons controlling various local storage keys and values. The local storage corresponds to an array made up of wrestler's names set to their team and point, which is generated in javascript. 

Each teams points are added up and displayed on the scoreboard, along with a list of the wrestlers, their team and their points. Along with the names being being searchable, if you click each category (Name, Points, and Team), the list will be sorted by that category. 

The CSS uses a gradient of colors matching those used in the official AEW logo at the top of the page to be visually appealing and while made with mobile in mind, the website looks great on desktop as well due to it's responsive design.
